# Readable App

This app was developed using React coupled with Redux. The concept is similar to Reddit with posts and comments and the ability to vote either up or down on each post and comment. 

## How to use

Either Clone or Fork this repository and run (in your terminal):
`cd frontend`
`npm install`
`npm start`

In a separate terminal:
`cd api-server`
`node server`

## Files

Be sure you have both `api-server` and `frontend` folders
