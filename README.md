# Readable App

This app was developed using React coupled with Redux. The concept is similar to Reddit with posts and comments and the ability to vote either up or down on each post and comment.

The Api-server was created by Udacity. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## How to use

Either Clone or Fork this repository and run (in your terminal)

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* Install and start the frontend app
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## Files

Be sure you have both `api-server` and `frontend` folders
